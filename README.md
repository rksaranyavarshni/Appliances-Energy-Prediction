# Appliances-Energy-Prediction

Consumption of electricity in our day-to-day life is inevitable
in this modern/ technology civilization. This data set
was chosen due to its significance in both residential and commercial
environments. Prediction of this energy consumption
will help every individual to be aware of the money spent
on electricity utilization. Analysis on this data set will be
answering below questions in detail as we progress with this
paper,
1) Can we predict the energy that will be consumed with
given parameters?
2) Can we identify the attributes that are most significant
when it comes to energy prediction?
